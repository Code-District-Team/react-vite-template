- Client-side data filtering, sorting, and searching.
- A search input to quickly filter data.
- Customizable column configuration.
- Filtering data using Ag-Grid's filter options.
- Pagination support.

## Component Structure

The code for the `LocalFiltersAgGrid` component is structured as follows:

- Import statements for required dependencies, including Ag-Grid, Ant Design components.
- Definition of `columnDefs` to configure the table columns.
- Configuration of default column settings.
- Definition of the `onSearch` function to handle search queries and set quick filters.
- Fetching of user data using the `fetchUsers` function.

## Usage

This component is designed to showcase the use of Ag-Grid for local filtering and displaying data efficiently on the client side.
You can customize and integrate it into your React application to provide a rich user experience for managing data.

To use the `LocalFiltersAgGrid`, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary dependencies into your React application.

```jsx
import "ag-grid-community/styles/ag-grid.css";
import "ag-grid-community/styles/ag-theme-alpine.css";
// import above ag-grid css if not included in your app's top-level
import { AgGridReact } from "ag-grid-react";
import { Card, Input } from "antd";
import { debounce } from "lodash";
import { useEffect, useMemo, useRef, useState } from "react";
import User from "~/models/user";
```

2. Create a React component and add following necessary statements and methods.

```jsx
export default function LocalFiltersAgGrid() {
  const gridRef = useRef(null);
  const [users, setUsers] = useState([]);

  const defaultColDef = useMemo(
    () => ({
      sortable: true,
      filter: true,
      flex: 1,
    }),
    [],
  );

  // Column definitions
  const columnDefs = [
    {
      headerName: "ID",
      field: "id",
    },
    {
      headerName: "First Name",
      field: "firstName",
    },
    {
      headerName: "Last Name",
      field: "lastName",
    },
    {
      headerName: "Email",
      field: "email",
    },
    {
      headerName: "Status",
      field: "status",
    },
  ];
}
```

3. Add following methods in the `LocalFiltersAgGrid`

- `onSearch` called on input search within table.
- `fetchUsers` called from useEffect on render.

```jsx
const onSearch = (evt) => {
  gridRef.current.api.setQuickFilter(evt.target.value);
};

const fetchUsers = async () => {
  try {
    const res = await User.getAll();
    setUsers(res.data);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
};

useEffect(() => {
  fetchUsers();
}, []);
```

4. In the final step add return statements with following jsx code in `LocalFiltersAgGrid` component.

```jsx
return (
  <Card
    title={
      <Input
        allowClear
        placeholder="Search in table"
        size="large"
        onChange={debounce(onSearch, 500)}
      />
    }
  >
    <div className="ag-theme-alpine" style={{ height: 400, maxwidth: 100 }}>
      <AgGridReact
        ref={gridRef}
        columnDefs={columnDefs}
        defaultColDef={defaultColDef}
        rowData={users}
        pagination
        paginationPageSize={10}
      />
    </div>
  </Card>
);
```

## Note

- Ensure you have the required dependencies, including Ag-Grid, Ant Design, lodash, installed in your project to use this component effectively.
- Customize the component to match your specific data source and UI requirements.
