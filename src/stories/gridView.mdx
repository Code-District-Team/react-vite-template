# Grid View for Products

The `ProductGridView` is a React component that displays a grid view of products with infinite scrolling.

## Features

- Display a grid view of products.
- Supports infinite scrolling for loading more products.
- Shows loading skeleton while loading data.
- Automatically loads more products when scrolling to the bottom.
- Displays product details such as name, quantity, and price.

## Component Structure

The code for the `ProductGridView` is organized into different sections, including:

- Import statements for required components and dependencies.
- The main `ProductGridView` component, which manages the list of products, including fetching on scroll.

## Usage

This component is designed to create a user-friendly product grid interface that allows users to load products on scrolling.
The component can be customized and integrated into your larger React application.

To use the `ProductGridView`, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary dependencies into your React application.

```jsx
import { Card, Divider, List, Skeleton } from "antd";
import { useEffect, useRef, useState } from "react";
import InfiniteScroll from "react-infinite-scroll-component";
import Product from "~/models/product";
```

2. Create a React component and add following necessary statements.

```jsx
export const ProductGridView = () => {
  const pageNumber = useRef(0);
  const [data, setData] = useState({ products: [], total: 0 });
};
```

3. Add following methods in the `ProductGridView`

- `fetchProductDetails` called from useEffect on render.

```jsx
const fetchProductDetails = async () => {
  try {
    pageNumber.current = pageNumber.current + 1;
    const payload = {
      page: pageNumber.current,
      limit: 6,
      filterType: "antd",
    };
    const response = await Product.getByFilters(payload);
    setData((prevData) => ({
      products: [...prevData.products, ...response.data.products],
      total: response.data.total,
    }));
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
};

useEffect(() => {
  fetchProductDetails();
}, []);
```

4. In the final step add return statements with following jsx code in `ProductGridView` component.

```jsx
return (
  <div id="scrollableDiv">
    <InfiniteScroll
      scrollableTarget="scrollableDiv"
      height={containerHeight}
      dataLength={data.products?.length || 0} // Safely access the length
      next={fetchProductDetails}
      hasMore={data.products?.length < data.total} // Compare against the total value
      loader={
        <Skeleton
          avatar
          paragraph={{
            rows: 1,
          }}
          active
        />
      }
      endMessage={<Divider plain>It is all, nothing more ü§ê</Divider>}
    >
      <List
        grid={{ column: 3, gutter: 16 }}
        dataSource={data.products}
        renderItem={(item) => (
          <List.Item key={item.id}>
            <Card title={item.name}>
              <List.Item.Meta />
              <p>Qty: {item.quantity}</p>
              <p>Price: {item.price}</p>
            </Card>
          </List.Item>
        )}
      />
    </InfiniteScroll>
  </div>
);
```

## Note

This component relies on external dependencies, such as Ant Design components and `react-infinite-scroll-component`. Make sure to import and configure these dependencies in your project.
